### Assignment 5 (due October 15)
1. Read the following topics in [Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php)
  - Dictionaries
  - Conditional Statements
  - Loops, While Loop
  - For Loops
2. Take Quiz 4 on Blackboard.
3. Create a Jupyter notebook. Write a Python code snippet in a code cell for each of the following problems. Use Markdown cells and comments to add necessary notes and text.  
	 1. Ask the user to input a numeric grade. Then output the corresponding letter grade. The grade scale is as follows: 90 - 100 A; 80 - 89 B; 70 - 79 C; 60 - 69 D; 0 - 59 F.
	 2. For two given lists, construct a new list that contains the elements common to both lists.
	 3. Use `for` loops to output the following matrix. 
     
     1   2   3   4   5

     2   4   6   8   10

     3   6   9   12  15
     
     4   8   12  16  20
	 
	 4. Output the numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where all three digits of a number are even. The numbers printed out are separated by commas. (Hint: ```x // 1 % 10```, ```x // 10 % 10```, and ```x // 100 % 10``` return, respectively, the units digit, the 10s digit and the 100s digit of a number x.) 
	 5. Combine two dictionaries into one. If a key exists in both dictionaries, then add the values together. Sample data: adict = {'a': 200, 'b': 300, 'c': 400}, bdict = {'a': 50, 'b': 20, 'd': 10, 'e': 60}. Sample output: {'a': 250, 'b': 320, 'c': 400, 'd': 10, 'e': 60}. 
4. Create directory `hw5` within your local repo. Copy the Jupyter notebook you created above to the directory. Then upload the file to your remote repo. Email the instructor the URL of your remote repo before the class on October 15. 
5. Review [Linear Algebra](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/refresher-algebra-calculus) (written by Afshine Amidi and Shervine Amidi).
